| 3.2.1   | What Is Encryption?           | Encryption scrambles data so only someone with the right key can read it.             | Sending an encrypted email that only the recipient can open.           |
| 3.2.2   | How Do You Encrypt Your Data? | Use software or system settings to encrypt files, folders, or entire drives.           | Turning on BitLocker on Windows to encrypt your hard drive.            |
| 3.2.3   | Back Up Your Data             | Make copies of important files and store them safely (cloud or external drive).        | Saving your photos on Google Drive or an external hard disk.           |
| 3.2.4   | Are They Really Gone?         | Deleted files can be recovered if not properly wiped.                                  | Emptying the Recycle Bin doesn't permanently delete a file.            |
| 3.2.5   | How Do You Delete Permanently?| Use secure delete tools to overwrite data and make it unrecoverable.                   | Using a tool like ‚ÄúEraser‚Äù to wipe a file completely from your drive.  |

‚úÖ **Pro Tips**:
- Always encrypt sensitive data before sharing.
- Use strong passwords for encrypted drives.
- Backups should also be encrypted if they contain private data.
- Use "secure delete" instead of just hitting delete.
