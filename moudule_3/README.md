Your computing devices are the portal to your online life, storing a lot of your personal data. Therefore, it‚Äôs important to protect the security of your devices.

### üîê Top Tips to Secure Your Devices

| Step | Description | Simple Example |
|------|-------------|----------------|
| **Turn the firewall on** | Use at least one type of firewall (software or hardware) to block unauthorized access. Keep it updated. | A software firewall on your laptop blocks suspicious incoming connections from the internet. |
| **Install antivirus and antispyware** | Antivirus detects and removes malicious software like viruses or spyware. Keep it up to date. | Norton or Windows Defender scans downloaded files and blocks harmful ones. |
| **Manage your OS and browser** | Set medium or high security settings and regularly update your system and browser to patch vulnerabilities. | Windows Update installs monthly security fixes; Chrome updates to patch known flaws. |
| **Set up password protection** | Protect all devices with strong passwords to prevent unauthorized access. Use password managers if needed. | Locking your phone with a complex PIN or using a password-protected user account on your PC. |

### ‚úÖ Best Practices

- Don‚Äôt install software from untrusted websites.
- Enable auto-updates wherever possible.
- Use two-factor authentication (2FA).
- Backup your important data regularly.
- Encrypt your drive if available (e.g., BitLocker, FileVault).

These simple steps help you safeguard your digital life from unauthorized access and malicious threats.

| 3.2.1   | What Is Encryption?           | Encryption scrambles data so only someone with the right key can read it.             | Sending an encrypted email that only the recipient can open.           |
| 3.2.2   | How Do You Encrypt Your Data? | Use software or system settings to encrypt files, folders, or entire drives.           | Turning on BitLocker on Windows to encrypt your hard drive.            |
| 3.2.3   | Back Up Your Data             | Make copies of important files and store them safely (cloud or external drive).        | Saving your photos on Google Drive or an external hard disk.           |
| 3.2.4   | Are They Really Gone?         | Deleted files can be recovered if not properly wiped.                                  | Emptying the Recycle Bin doesn't permanently delete a file.            |
| 3.2.5   | How Do You Delete Permanently?| Use secure delete tools to overwrite data and make it unrecoverable.                   | Using a tool like ‚ÄúEraser‚Äù to wipe a file completely from your drive.  |

‚úÖ **Pro Tips**:
- Always encrypt sensitive data before sharing.
- Use strong passwords for encrypted drives.
- Backups should also be encrypted if they contain private data.
- Use "secure delete" instead of just hitting delete.
