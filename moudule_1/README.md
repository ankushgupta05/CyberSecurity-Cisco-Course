Understanding these types helps us appreciate the importance of cybersecurity and responsible hacking.








## 🔐 Internal vs External Cyber Threats

| Type of Threat        | Description                                                             | Example                                                               |
|-----------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Internal Threat**   | A cyber threat that comes from someone *inside* the organization.        | An employee who accidentally shares sensitive data or installs malware. |
| **External Threat**   | A cyber threat that comes from *outside* the organization.               | A hacker trying to break into a company system from another country.   |

> 🧠 **Quick Tip**: Not all internal threats are intentional — sometimes it’s just a careless mistake!
