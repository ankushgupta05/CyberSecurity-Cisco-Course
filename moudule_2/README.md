# Types of Malware

| **Malware Type**    | **Explanation**                                                                                                                                      | **Example**                                                                                     |

| **Spyware**          | Spyware monitors your online activity, tracks your keystrokes, and captures sensitive information such as banking details. It often bundles with legitimate software. | A keylogger that records your every keystroke, including your password, and sends it to hackers.  |
| **Adware**           | Adware delivers unwanted advertisements, often in the form of pop-ups. It is typically bundled with free software and can include spyware.              | A browser that constantly displays pop-up ads while you're browsing a website.                   |
| **Backdoor**         | Backdoor malware bypasses normal authentication procedures to gain unauthorized remote access to a system. It works in the background, making it hard to detect. | A hacker using a backdoor to remotely control a computer and steal files without the owner's knowledge. |
| **Ransomware**       | Ransomware encrypts data and holds it hostage, demanding payment to release it. It is often spread through phishing emails or system vulnerabilities.    | Your files become encrypted, and a message appears demanding payment to unlock them.            |
| **Scareware**        | Scareware uses scare tactics to trick you into running a malicious program by showing fake warnings about system threats.                            | A pop-up warning that your computer is infected and urging you to install a fake antivirus program. |
| **Rootkit**          | A rootkit modifies the operating system to create a backdoor for attackers, making it hard to detect. It can escalate privileges and hide malicious activity. | A hacker using a rootkit to gain remote control over a computer and hide their actions from antivirus software. |
| **Virus**            | A virus replicates itself and attaches to executable files. It requires user interaction and can act destructively, such as deleting or corrupting files. | A virus that attaches to a document, and when opened, spreads to other files, corrupting them.     |
| **Trojan Horse**     | A Trojan appears legitimate but carries out malicious operations. It exploits user privileges and is often disguised in files like images or games.     | A game that seems fun but secretly installs malware to steal personal data when played.          |
| **Worms**            | Worms replicate themselves to spread across computers, often over a network. Unlike viruses, they don't need a host program to run.                    | A worm spreads through a network, infecting every computer connected to it without any user interaction. |

| Software that automatically delivers advertisements                                                           | **Adware**          | A browser that constantly shows pop-up ads while you're browsing the web.                                                                                 | Adware delivers unwanted ads and is often bundled with free software. It can also include tracking features like spyware.   |
| Malware that holds a computer system captive until a payment is made to the attacker                           | **Ransomware**      | A message appears demanding payment to decrypt files that have been locked by ransomware.                                                                  | Ransomware encrypts files or locks a system and demands payment to restore access, often exploiting system vulnerabilities. |
| Malicious code that attaches to legitimate programs and usually spreads by USB drives, optical media, network shares, or email | **Virus**           | A virus attached to an email attachment that spreads to all files once the attachment is opened.                                                            | A virus infects a legitimate file and spreads through interaction (e.g., via email attachments, USB drives).                |
| Malicious code that replicates itself independently by exploiting vulnerabilities in networks                  | **Worms**           | A worm that spreads across a network, infecting each connected computer without any user interaction.                                                       | Worms self-replicate and spread across systems through network vulnerabilities, unlike viruses, which require a host.      |
