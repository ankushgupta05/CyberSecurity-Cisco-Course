| **Backdoor**         | Backdoor malware bypasses normal authentication procedures to gain unauthorized remote access to a system. It works in the background, making it hard to detect. | A hacker using a backdoor to remotely control a computer and steal files without the owner's knowledge. |
| **Ransomware**       | Ransomware encrypts data and holds it hostage, demanding payment to release it. It is often spread through phishing emails or system vulnerabilities.    | Your files become encrypted, and a message appears demanding payment to unlock them.            |
| **Scareware**        | Scareware uses scare tactics to trick you into running a malicious program by showing fake warnings about system threats.                            | A pop-up warning that your computer is infected and urging you to install a fake antivirus program. |
| **Rootkit**          | A rootkit modifies the operating system to create a backdoor for attackers, making it hard to detect. It can escalate privileges and hide malicious activity. | A hacker using a rootkit to gain remote control over a computer and hide their actions from antivirus software. |
| **Virus**            | A virus replicates itself and attaches to executable files. It requires user interaction and can act destructively, such as deleting or corrupting files. | A virus that attaches to a document, and when opened, spreads to other files, corrupting them.     |
